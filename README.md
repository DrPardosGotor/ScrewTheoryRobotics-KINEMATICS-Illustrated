# ScrewTheoryRobotics-KINEMATICS-Illustrated
Screw Theory for Robotics - A practical approach for modern Robot Mechanics - A KINEMATICS Handbook Illustrated.
This a collection of EXAMPLES, EXERCISES and SIMULATIONS for better understanding the basics of Screw Theory for Robotics. It is focused on KINEMATICS (i.e. forward, inverse, differential) for very well known robot mechanics configurations.
The material included here supports the handbook and its a fundamental content to really grasp the topics illustrated.
Both the handbook and this are used for the "Screw Theory for Robotics" Seminar in the "Robotics Master" at the University Carlos III of Madrid.
It can be also used for anyone interested in the subject.
