# ScrewTheoryRobotics-KINEMATICS-Illustrated
Screw Theory for Robotics - A practical approach for modern Robot Mechanics - A KINEMATICS Handbook Illustrated.
This a collection of EXAMPLES, EXERCISES and SIMULATIONS for better understanding the basics of Screw Theory for Robotics. It is focused on KINEMATICS (i.e. forward, inverse, differential) for very well known robot mechanics configurations.
The material included supports the handbook and its a fundamental content to really grasp the topics illustrated.
Both the handbook and this repository are used for the "Screw Theory for Robotics" Seminar in the "Robotics Master" at the University Carlos III of Madrid.
The goal of this repository is to show the advantages of the Screw Theory mathematics for robotics with clear and simple examples for an easier understanding. The software performance is not the priority, even though you will realize it is really good when compared with more traditional aproaches.
We are sure all these contents will be a foundation very useful for your robotics developments and applications!
