Screw Theory for Robotics - A KINEMATICS Handbook Illustrated - A practical approach for modern Robot Mechanics.
This a collection of EXAMPLES, EXERCISES and SIMULATIONS for better understanding the basics of Screw Theory for Robotics. It is focused on KINEMATICS (i.e. forward, inverse, differential) for very well known robot mechanics configurations.
This content is an extra material to support the handbook used in the "Screw Theory for Robotics" Seminar in the "Robotics Master" of the University Carlos III of Madrid. It can be also used for anyone interested in the subject.
