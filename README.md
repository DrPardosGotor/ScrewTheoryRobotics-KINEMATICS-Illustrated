# ScrewTheoryRobotics-KINEMATICS-Illustrated
Screw Theory for Robotics - A KINEMATICS Handbook Illustrated - A practical approach for modern Robot Mechanics.
This a collection of EXAMPLES, EXERCISES and SIMULATIONS to understand better the basics of Screw Theory KINEMATICS for Robotics. It is focused on KINEMATICS (i.e. forward, inverse, differential) for very well known robot mechanics configurations.
This content is an extra material to support the handbook, which has the contents of a Seminar on this subject teached at the "Robotics Master" of the University Carlos III of Madrid. It can be also used for anyone interested in the subject.
