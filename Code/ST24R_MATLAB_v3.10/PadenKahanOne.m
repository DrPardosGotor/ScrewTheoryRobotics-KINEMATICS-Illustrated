%% "PADENKAHANONE" Find the Inverse Kinematics of a single ROTATION SCREW
% when applied to a point in SE(3).
%
% 	Theta1 = PadenKahanOne(x1, pp, pk)
%   by Dr. Pardos-Gotor ST24R "Screw Theory Toolbox for Robotics" MATLAB.
%
% Compute the magnitude "Theta" (angle) of the Screw, to
% move the point "p" from its original position to the point "k" by
% the ROTATION of the Twist x1.
%
%         |v|
% E = x1 =| | (6x1); and the points p and k are (3x1) coordinates. 
%         |w|
% exp(E^Theta) * p = k
%
% For a SCREW of pure ROTATION:
% Based on the work of Paden & Kahan subproblem ONE for INVERSE KINEMATICS.
% For a SCREW of pure ROTATION the problem has two solutions t1 and t1-2pi, 
% but the trivial second one is not considered, even though it might be a
% valid solutions in robotics and calculated as follows:
% switch sign(t11)
%    case -1
%        t12 = 2*pi+t11;
%    case 0
%        t12 = 2*pi;
%    case 1
%        t12 = t11-2*pi;
%    otherwise
%        t12 = NaN;
%    end
% IDEA: In fact it computes "Theta" to rotate the vector u' around x1
% to make it parallel to the vector v', but "p" and "k" can be in
% different planes and even u' and v' be of different module, but o course
% both planes are parallel & perpendicular to the axis of x1, then “p” and
% “k” can not coincide after the movement, but the algorithm works.
