%% "PADENKAHANTHREE" Find the Inverse Kinematics of a ROTATION SCREW
% which applied to a point move it to a certain
% distance from another point in space in SE(3).
%
% 	Theta1 = PadenKahanThree(x1, pp, pk, de)
%   by Dr. Pardos-Gotor ST24R "Screw Theory Toolbox for Robotics" MATLAB.
%
% Compute the magnitude Theta1 of the Screw with twist x1, to move the
% point "pp" from its position in 3D to another point "c" or "e" complying
% that the distance between "c" or "e" to the point "pk" is "de". 
% 
%         |v|
% E = x1 =| | (6x1); the points pp, pk, c and e are (3x1). 
%         |w|
% exp(E^Theta) * pp = c; and de = norm(c-pk) and de = norm(e-pk).
%
% For a SCREW of pure ROTATION:
% Based on the Paden & Kahan subproblem Three for INVERSE KINEMATICS.
% The problem could has zero, one or two solutions, Theta1 = [t11; t12]
% Besides the problem could have another two solutions t11-2pi and t12-2pi, 
% but these trivial second ones are not considered, even though it might be
% valid and useful solutions for robotics.
