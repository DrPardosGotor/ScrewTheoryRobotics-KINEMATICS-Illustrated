%% "PARDOSONE" Find the Inverse Kinematics of a single TRANSLATION SCREW
% when appliee to a point in SE(3).

% 	Theta1 = PardosOne(x1, pp, pk)
%   by Dr. Pardos-Gotor ST24R "Screw Theory Toolbox for Robotics" MATLAB.
%
% Compute the magnitude "Theta" (distance) of the Screw, to
% move the point "p" from its original position to the point "k" by
% TRANSLATION of the Twist x1.
%
%         |v|
% E = x1 =| | (6x1); and the points p and k are (3x1) coordinates. 
%         |w|
% exp(E^Theta) * p = k
%
% For a SCREW of pure TRANSLATION:
% the problen has one solution t1, which is proposed by Pardos-Gotor
% (even though is quite trivial) for the sake of resolving problems
% regardless of the joint type (rotation or translation)
% this computes the magnitude "Theta" (distance) of the Screw, to move the
% point "p" to the point "k" by the TRANSLATION of the Twist x1. 
% IDEA: In fact it computes "Theta" to move a plane where is "p" to 
% another plane where is "k" (planes are parallel) and move in direction of
% the x1 axis; then “p” and “k” can not coincide after the movement.
