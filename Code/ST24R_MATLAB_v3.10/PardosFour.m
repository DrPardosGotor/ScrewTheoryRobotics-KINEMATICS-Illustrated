%% "PARDOSFOUR" Find the Inverse Kinematics of two consecutive
%
% SCREWS whose axes are parallel (do not have a common point in space)
% which applied to a point move it ot a different point in space. In SE(3).

% 	Theta1Theta2 = PardosFour(x1, x2, pp, pk)
%
% In the case of TWO CONSECUTIVE ROTATIONS:
% Compute angles "Th2" and "Th1" of two subsequently applies SCREWS with
% corresponding twists x2 and x1, to move the point "p" to the point "k".
% Beware of the order for the movement, first applied x2 & subsequently x1.
% Point p is first moved to the point "c" or "d" by the Screw with Theta2
% and then moved from "c" or "d" to the point "k" by the Screw with Theta1.
%
% exp(E1^Theta1) * exp(E2^Theta2) * p = exp(E1^Theta1) * (c or d) = k
%          |v|
% Ei = xi =| | is 6x1 ; and p and k are points (3x1).
%          |w|
% Based on the work of Pardos subproblem for this type INVERSE KINEMATICS.
% The problem could have up to TWO DOUBLE solutions for Theta1-Theta2:
% Theta1Theta2 = [t11 t21; t12 t22]
% as a consequence of the possible paths from p-c-k or p-d-k.
% The problem could have two solutions for each Theta, which is Theta-2pi, 
% but the trivial second one is not considered, even though it might be a
% valid solutions in robotics.

% perpendicular to the points "pp" and "pk".

    u = pp - r2; uw2 = w2*w2'*u; up = u-uw2; nup = norm(up); c2 = r2+uw2;

% Then we obtain the points "pc" and "pd" as the intersection of the two
% circumpherences defined by the radius "pp - c2" and "pk - c1".
