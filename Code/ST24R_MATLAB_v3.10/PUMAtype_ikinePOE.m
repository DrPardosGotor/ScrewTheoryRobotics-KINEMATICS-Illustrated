% Calculate the IK solutions Theta using the SCREW THEORY techniques
% and basically the PADEN-KAHAN-PARDOS Canonic Subproblems.

noap = TcpGoal;
Hst0 = TcpInit;
% STEP1: Calculate Theta3.
% With "pf" on the axis of E4, E5, E6 and "pk" on the axis of E1, E2.
% We apply (noap*gs0^-1) to "pf" and take the norm of the diffence of that
% resulting point and "pk". Doing so we can calculate Theta3 applying the
% Canonic problem PADEN-KAHAN-THREE, because the screws E4,E5,E6 do not affect
% "pf" and the E1,E2 do not affect the norm of a vector with an end on "pk"
% resulting the problem ||exp(E3^theta3)*pf-pk||=||noap*gs0^-1*pf-pk||
% which by PADEN-KAHAN-THREE has none, one or two solutions for t31 t32.
noapHst0if = noap*(Hst0\[pf; 1]); pkp = noapHst0if(1:3);
de = norm(pkp - pk);
t3 = PadenKahanThree(Twist6R(:,3), pf, pk, de);
Theta(1,3) = t3(1); Theta(5,3) = t3(2); % put results into Theta
Theta(3,:) = Theta(1,:); Theta(7,:) = Theta(5,:); % prepare Theta for next
%
% STEP2: Calculate Theta1 & Theta2.
% With "pf" on the axis of E4, E5, E6 we apply (noap*gs0^-1) to "pf" and
% the POE E1..E6 also to "pf" having already known the value for Theta3
% resulting exactly a Canonic problem PADEN-KAHAN-TWO, because the screws
% E4,E5,E6 do not affect "pf" and the E3 is known (two values),resulting
% the problem exp(E1^theta1)*exp(E2^theta2)*pf' = noap*gs0^-1*pf
% which by PADEN-KAHAN-TWO has none, one or two DOUBLE solutions
% t11-t21 & t12-t22 for each value of t3, but we have two, then consider
% for t31 we get t11-t21 & t12-t22 & for t32 we get t13-t23 & t14-t24.
t1t2 = zeros(4,2);
for i = 1:2                   % for the TWO values of t3.
    j = i+fix(i/2);
    pfpt = trexp(Twist6R(:,3)',t3(i))*[pf; 1];
    pfp = pfpt(1:3);
    t1t2(j:j+1,1:2) = PadenKahanTwo(Twist6R(:,1),Twist6R(:,2),pfp,pkp);
end

    Theta(i,1:2) = t1t2(j,1:2); % put t1t2 values into Theta
    Theta(i+1,:) = Theta(i,:);  % prepare Theta for next step
end
%
% STEP3: Calculate Theta4 & Theta5.
% With "pp" on the axis of E6 apply E3^-1*E2^-1*E1^-1*noap*gs0^-1 to "pp"
% and also the POE E4*E5*E6 to "pp" knowing already Theta3-Theta2-Theta1,
% resulting exactly a Canonic problem PADEN-KAHAN-TWO, because the screws
% E6 does not affect "pp" & Th3-Th2-Th1 known (four solutions), the problem
% exp(E4^theta4)*exp(E5^theta5)*pp = pk2p ; with
% pk2p = exp(E3^Th3)^-1*exp(E2^Th2)^-1*exp(E1^Th1)^-1*noap*gs0^-1*pp 
% which by PADEN-KAHAN-TWO has none, one or two DOUBLE solutions:
% t31,t21,t11 to t41-t51 & t42-t52 ; t31,t22,t12 to t43-t53 & t44-t54
% t32,t23,t13 to t45-t55 & t46-t56 ; t32,t24,t14 to t47-t57 & t48-t58
%
t4t5 = zeros(8,2);
noapHst0ip = noap*(Hst0\[pp; 1]); 
for i = 1:2:7                     % for the 4 values of t3-t2-t1.
    pk2pt = (trexp(Twist6R(:,1)',Theta(i,1)))\noapHst0ip;
    pk2pt = (trexp(Twist6R(:,2)',Theta(i,2)))\pk2pt;
    pk2pt = (trexp(Twist6R(:,3)',Theta(i,3)))\pk2pt;
    pk2p = pk2pt(1:3);
    t4t5(i:i+1,1:2) = PadenKahanTwo(Twist6R(:,4),Twist6R(:,5),pp,pk2p); 
end
    Theta(1:8,4:5) = t4t5;          % put t4t5 values into Theta
% STEP4: Calculate Theta6.
% With "po" not in the axis of E6 apply E5^-1...*E1^-1*noap*gs0^-1 to "po"
% and applying E6 to "po" knowing already Theta5...Theta1 (8 solutions),
% resulting exactly a Canonic problem PADEN-KAHAN-ONE, the problem:
% exp(E6^theta6)*po = pk3p ; with
% pk3p = exp(E5^Th5)^-1*...*exp(E1^Th1)^-1*noap*gs0^-1*po 
% which by PADEN-KAHAN-ONE has none or one solution. Then for all
% Th5-Th4-Th3-Th2-Th1 known (eight solutions) we get t61...t68:
noapHst0io = noap*(Hst0\[po; 1]);
for i = 1:8
    pk2pt = (trexp(Twist6R(:,1)',Theta(i,1)))\noapHst0io;
